qtrc v1.2.0
by Mew151 from LD4all

==Overview==

qtrc is an application to remind you to reality check! It's pretty sweet.
By the way, did you reality check?

==Compiling qtrc==

In order to compile qtrc, you need qt (really?) and qmake. You'll need to install
your distribution's versions of the latest version of Qt and the Qt development (qt-devel) packages.
Then you can simply run:
	qmake
	make
	sudo make install

And it will be done.

==Running qtrc==

To run qtrc, simply run "qtrc" from the terminal, file manager, start menu, etc.
